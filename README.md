# Zero to accessibility expert

This is a non-exhaustive and opinionated guide to becoming an accessibility expert. What you should learn depends on the specialization that you want to target.

In general, this will look something like this: 

1. Learn the fundamentals (types of disabilities, standards, laws, etc)
2. Learn how to use assistive technologies
3. Learn how to do an assessment
4. Specific topics for your specialization(s)

## Learn the fundamentals

The fundamentals include topics such as types of disabilities, standards, laws, etc.

### Learn WCAG

[WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) is the international standard for digital accessibility. It has been adopted by many governments as a legal requirement. As such, it is used to assess how well a given digital resource meets the minimal requirements for accessibility. As such, this is a vital resource to learn.

One critical thing to understand about WCAG (and standards in general) is the difference between "normative" and "non-normative" or "informative". Parts of WCAG are marked as "normative", which means that these sections are required for conformance. The rest of WCAG, including supporting documents, are marked as "non-normative" or "informative", which means that these sections are not required for conformance. In other words, when performing an WCAG audit, an accessibility expert must only test to the "normative" parts of WCAG, and can not fail something if it is not a "normative" requirement or if it is only mentioned in "non-normative" information. For more information on why this is important, read [Accessibility auditing and ego](https://ericwbailey.design/writing/accessibility-auditing-and-ego/).

Pay close attention to:

* [The WCAG SC for level A and AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#perceivable) (normative). These are the requirements that WCAG defines. Most laws do not include level AAA SC.
* [WCAG conformance requirements](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#conformance) (normative).
* [WCAG glossary](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/#glossary) (normative).
* [Understanding WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/) (informative). Many parts of WCAG, including the SC, can be difficult to understand. This document attempts to make WCAG more understandable, by providing examples, further details, and further information about different parts of WCAG.
* [WCAG Techniques](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/). The WCAG techniques describe different ways that SC can pass or fail.
